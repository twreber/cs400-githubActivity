There once was a man named Jerry.  He lived in a small house on several hundred acres of land with his dog, also named Jerry.  Jerry and Jerry lived a simple life
relying on no one but eachother's company to be happy.  However, that all changed on day when Jerry decided to lash out at his owner, Jerry.  Jerry had just about
of Jerry and wanted someone other than Jerry to keep him company.  So Jerry, being the mischeivious dog he was, did the only logical thing and ran away after Jerry
went to sleep.  Jerry was a dog so he didn't really know where he could go outside of where he always lived but he would figure that out as he went.
