There once was a man named Jerry.  He lived in a small house on several hundred acres of land with his dog, also named Jerry.  Jerry and Jerry lived a simple life
relying on no one but eachother's company to be happy.  However, that all changed on day when Jerry decided to lash out at his owner, Jerry.  Jerry had just about
of Jerry and wanted someone other than Jerry to keep him company.  So Jerry, being the mischeivious dog he was, did the only logical thing and ran away after Jerry
went to sleep.  Jerry was a dog so he didn't really know where he could go outside of where he always lived but he would figure that out as he went.

In the middle of the night Jerry snuck out with the utmost stealth. He got to the road and never looked back. This was his life now. A wonderer. There were so many 
things to explore, but most importantly, sniff. Scents Jerry had never smelt in his entire life were now surrounding him in a flurry. There was no way to know what 
the right direction to go in. He composed himself and went in the direction of the smell that he knew. Rabbits. Jerry followed the scent of the Rabbits for miles. I
have to be getting close, he thought to himself. Then just as he got over the hill, he came to a sight that made him stop in his tracks.

Behold! Jerry couldn't believe his eyes. A wide open gate with a sign that said, "DOG PARK", stood in front of him. Through the gate he could see hundreds of
other dogs gleefully playing with their owners. This was his chance, Jerry thought to himself. "I need to put on my best face and impress somebody here so 
they'll adopt me." With his chest pushed out, head held high and a new-found sense of elegance, Jerry pranced through the gate. Little did he know what was to
come next.
